# About Me

Hi there! I'm Shane, an IT professional with over a decade and half of experience spanning various domains in technology. My journey in IT has allowed me to develop a broad skill set, ranging from network and system administration to cybersecurity and web development. Now, I'm fully pivoting towards being a **Security Operations Analyst**, Then transitioning into **Threat Intelligence/Penetration testing**. driven by my passion for protecting and securing digital infrastructures.

I’ve evolved from working as a mobile, computer, and network technician to becoming deeply immersed in the world of cybersecurity. My journey has been shaped by various roles, including working as a Digital Specialist and Projectionist, managing both technical operations and digital systems for Olympus Theaters. These experiences have honed my ability to tackle complex technical problems with creative solutions.

Outside of work, I’m an avid photographer, audiophile, and gamer exploring digital landscapes and honing my strategic thinking is what enjoy.

I’ve always embraced the idea that learning is a lifelong adventure. Whether I’m delving into the nuances of network security, experimenting with new culinary recipes, or exploring the latest photography techniques, my curiosity is the driving force behind all my endeavors.

Beyond security, I’m dedicated to staying at the forefront of **tech innovation**. My ability to engineer high-quality prompts has led me to dive deep into AI and automation workflows, helping businesses and individuals optimize and secure their technology stacks.
