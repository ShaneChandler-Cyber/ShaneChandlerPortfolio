# About Me

Hello! I'm Shane Chandler, an IT professional with over 15 years of experience spanning various domains in technology. My journey in IT has allowed me to develop a broad skill set, ranging from network administration to system engineering. Now, I'm fully pivoting towards **Cybersecurity**, driven by my passion for protecting and securing digital infrastructures.

In the realm of cybersecurity, I am focused on threat intelligence, penetration testing, and security operations. I’ve worked with tools like **Kali Linux**, **Metasploit**, **ELK Stack**, and **Security Onion** to strengthen my hands-on expertise. I've configured firewalls, set up SIEM systems, and monitored network traffic in real-time—all while building a home lab that showcases these abilities.

Beyond security, I’m dedicated to staying at the forefront of **tech innovation**. My ability to engineer high-quality prompts has led me to dive deep into AI and automation workflows, helping businesses and individuals optimize and secure their technology stacks.

When I’m not working or learning, I enjoy spending time with my dogs and working on community-driven projects. I'm always eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and professionals, so feel free to reach out!
