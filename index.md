# Key Projects

## Project 1: Home Network SIEM Setup

I built a secure home network with Access Control Lists (ACLs) and integrated it with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Security Onion. This setup involved configuring firewalls and creating custom detection rules to monitor and analyze real-time network traffic, helping to detect and respond to potential threats.

## Project 2: ELK Stack Deployment

Successfully configured and deployed the ELK Stack on a Linux Virtual Machine (VM). This included setting up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log collection, processing, and visualization. The system helps in analyzing security logs from various sources and provides actionable insights.

## Project 3: Cybersecurity Lab Setup (Ongoing)

Currently working on a cybersecurity lab to simulate real-world scenarios involving penetration testing, threat detection, and mitigation using tools such as Nessus, Metasploit, and Kali Linux. The goal is to sharpen my skills in vulnerability scanning and ethical hacking as I prepare for the OSCP and Pentest+ certifications.

## Roadmap

My professional journey is focused on becoming a SOC Analyst and later advancing into a cyber threat intelligence role. I'm actively building skills and planning to take key certifications such as OSCP, Pentest+, and CISSP to bolster my technical expertise.
